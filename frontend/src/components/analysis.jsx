          <p>This is the upload section of the application where users can upload a PDF. Once uploaded, the PDF is chunked, and each chunk is assigned an ID and stored in the Pinecone database as vectors. After this, the user is redirected to the chat feature of the application. Iâ€™ve limited the upload size to PDFs under 1MB to ensure the process remains fast. The smaller the file size, the faster the chunking and processing will be.</p>

          <p className='px-4'>This is the chat feature where users can ask questions specifically about the PDF they uploaded. The system is designed to only provide responses based on the content of the uploaded document. Any questions outside the scope of the PDF will not be answered, and the user will receive a message indicating that the information is not available in the document. This ensures focused and relevant interactions, keeping the conversation centered on the content of the uploaded file. </p>

          <p>I uploaded a PDF on software engineering, and the system provided responses based on the content of the uploaded document. While it works to a certain extent, there is room for improvement to make the responses even more accurate and aligned with the document's content. </p>
