          Hi, My name is Ndukwe Daniel and this is My Foundation project for ALX_SE the name of my application is called <strong>Readmee</strong>.  <strong>Readmee</strong> is a PDF application that allows users to upload and interact with documents easily. With built-in Ai, users can ask questions about the uploaded PDF and receive real-time, relevant answers based on the document's content
        </p>

        <h3 className='text-2xl font-semibold mb-5 mt-20 text-white underline'>What Inspired Me</h3>
        <p className='text-lg mb-6 text-white'>
        The inspiration behind <i><strong>Readmee</strong></i> was my laziness! As a student in a Nigerian university, I often get assigned PDFs to read, most of the time I do not want to read them. So, I wanted to create an application that could help me summarize PDFs and highlight the important parts, or even predict my exam questions. I just wanted to pass without reading, so many thing i would read just to be asked a few in the hall. But as the world would have it, the application was not able to predict my exam questions. Thank you for listening ðŸ’œ.
        </p>
